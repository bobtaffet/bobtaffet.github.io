			<p>Bob began teaching himself to play the guitar at age 4.  He has not stopped learning and growing as a musician.  In addition to performing on the doublebass, he is also a conductor, an arranger and has composed music for film and TV.  At age 7 he achieved his novice Amateur Radio license and spent the next decade builing radios and audio equipment.  His interest in tech morphed into a passion for designing and developing software.  Bob is also an avid, life long sailor having raced dinghies up and down the Eastern seaboard, raced offshore yachts and has made several ocean voyages.</p>
